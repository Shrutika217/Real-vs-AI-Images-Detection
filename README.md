🧠 Real vs AI Image Detection
A machine learning project that detects whether an image is AI-generated or real using deep learning and computer vision techniques. This tool aims to contribute to the growing need for detecting synthetic media in a world of increasing AI-generated content.

🚀 Features:

🖼️ Classifies images as either real or AI-generated
📊 Supports evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
🔍 Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and/or pretrained models
🧪 Trained on diverse datasets of real and AI-generated images
🛠️ Easily extendable for other types of media detection
